Data Types are used to define the type of the data.Javascript is dynamically typed language(data type of a variable is not fixed). To find the type of a variable, we can use 'typeof' of operator
eg: typeof a;
There are two types of data types are there. they are:
 i. primitve data types:
    Primitive data types are the bsic data types that represents single values. They are:
    a. number: number is the data type of any numerical value(interger or decimal)
    Eg: let a=25;
    let b=4.67;

    b.string: string is the data type of alphanumerical values(includes numbers,special symbols,characters)
    eg:let x="something";
      let y="23";

    c. boolean: boolean is used to store true or false. it is also represented true as 1 and false as 0
     eg: let z=true;

    d.undefined: represents accidental absence of value (or) value that has been declared but not have any value
    eg: let p= undefined;

    e. null: represents intentional absence of value
    eg:let q=null;

 ii. non primitive data types: non primitive data types holds multiple values with addresses. These are also called reference data types.
    a. Arrays
    b. objects
    c. functions
