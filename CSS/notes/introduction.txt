CSS(cascading style sheets) is used to design/style the web page. They were introduced in 1994.
To design a website well,
we need to concentrate three things:
   -- eye-friendly colours
   -- fonts
   -- layout

1. How to Link CSS to HTML?
We can link CSS to HTML in three ways
  i. inline CSS:
     we can apply styles in html elements opening tag , style as a attribute.
     <h1 style="background-color: aqua;color: red;">
        Happy Children's Day
    </h1>
    /* create paragraph that says happy Children's day 
    and apply inline css for background-color and color properties */
  ii. Internal CSS:
    we can apply styles to any element/elements using 
    style as a element
    syntax: 
    selector
    {
       //properties
    }
eg:<style>
        h1
        {
          background-color: blue;
          color: white;
        }
    </style>
/* create 4 paragraphs with some dummy data and apply same background-color and color properties to all paragraphs using internal CSS */

iii. External CSS:
we can create separate CSS file and attach to HTML using link tag.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">

Inline >!important> Internal = External(mostly External dominates Internal)
!important will be added to properties values such that its preference will be higher level
eg: h1{
            background-color: green !important;
        }
      

Basic Selectors:
Selectors are used to identify an element of HTML in CSS
You can identify an element basically in three ways
  i. tag: we can define properties using tags so that
  all elements with that tag will be selected
  ii. classname: if we need to select few elements, we can assign same class name to all and identify the class name
  in CSS using dot notation
  eg: <h1 class="myClass">Hello World</h1>
  <style>
    .myClass{
      color:red;
    }
    </style>
   iii. idname: if we need to select only one element, we can use id . we can identify id in css by using # notation.
    eg: <h1 id="something">Hello World</h1>
  <style>
    #something{
      color:red;
    }
    </style>
   Note: An element might contain multiple class names and multiple element might contain same class name. id's are always unique

   id>class>tag

Combinators:
direct-child(>): we can identify an element direct child
 using >
descendant(' ') : we can identify an element using space combinator for descendants
Eg: div>h1 means h1 which is direct child of div
div h1 means h1 which is descendant of div
Adjacent sibling selector(+):
we can identify an element which comes right after another 
element using '+'
General Sibling Selector(~):
we can identify an element which comes after an element 
using ~
