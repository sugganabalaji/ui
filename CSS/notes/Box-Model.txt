Box Model: 
      In CSS, Every element is treated as a Box. A Box Typically Contains 
     I. Border: border is used to outline any element. we can define border as      border: border-width border-style border-color;
we can  also specify different borders such as border-left, border-right, border-bottom, border-top;
      To achieve corner radius, we use border-radius:size;
we can also assign border-top-left-radius,border-top-right-radius,
border-bottom-left-radius,border-bottom-right-radius
     II. Margin: Margin is the space outside the border.
   we can use margin-top,margin-bottom,margin-left,margin-right,
   margin: 10px will assign 10px to all sides
   margin: 10px 20px will assign 10px to top and bottom and 20px to left and right
   margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px will assign respective sides starting from top to left in clock wise direction
     III. padding: we can also assign padding similar to margin. padding is the gap between border and content(internal space)


By default , every box sizes as content-box. If padding is given, it might increase height and width of box.
if you do not want to change height / width by padding, you can use
box-sizing: border-box
