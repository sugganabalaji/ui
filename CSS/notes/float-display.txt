1. float in CSS
The float property is used to position elements to the left or right of their container and allow other elements (like text) to flow around them.

Values of float:
none: Default value. The element does not float.
left: The element floats to the left of its container.
right: The element floats to the right of its container.
inherit: The element inherits the float value of its parent.
Example:
<div style="float: left; width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: lightblue;">
    I am floated left.
</div>
<p>This text flows around the floated box.</p>
Common Issues with float:
Floated elements are removed from the normal document flow, which can cause parent containers to collapse if they donâ€™t account for the height of the floated elements.
Clearing Floats:
To fix layout issues caused by float, you can use the clear property:
.clearfix::after {
    content: "";
    display: block;
    clear: both;
}
Apply .clearfix to the container of floated elements.

2. display Property in CSS
The display property determines how an element is displayed in the document.

Common Values of display:
block
inline
inline-block
display: block
Block-level elements occupy the full width of their parent container and start on a new line.
Examples of block-level elements: <div>, <p>, <h1>.
Key Characteristics:
Takes up the full width of its parent container.
Starts on a new line (other elements appear below it).
Example:
<div style="display: block; background-color: lightcoral;">
    I am a block element.
</div>
<div style="display: block; background-color: lightblue;">
    I am another block element.
</div>
display: inline
Inline elements do not start on a new line. They only take up as much width as necessary.
Examples of inline elements: <span>, <a>, <strong>.
Key Characteristics:
Only takes as much width as the content inside it.
Does not accept width and height properties (these are ignored).
Example:
<span style="display: inline; background-color: lightgreen;">I am inline</span>
<span style="display: inline; background-color: lightpink;">I am next to you</span>
display: inline-block
Combines characteristics of both block and inline:
It behaves like inline (does not start a new line).
It behaves like block (you can set width and height).
Key Characteristics:
Does not start a new line.
Accepts width and height.
Example:
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 100px; height: 50px; background-color: lightblue;">
    I am inline-block.
</span>
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 100px; height: 50px; background-color: lightcoral;">
    I am next to you.
</span>
When to Use These Properties
block: Use for large structural elements like sections, articles, or containers.
inline: Use for text styling, links, or elements that flow naturally with text.
inline-block: Use when you want elements side-by-side but still able to set dimensions.
Combining float and display
Floats and display values are often used together for layouts. For example:

<div style="float: left; display: block; width: 50%; background-color: lightblue;">
    I am floated and take 50% of the width.
</div>
<div style="float: right; display: block; width: 50%; background-color: lightcoral;">
    I am floated to the right.
</div>
