Git: Git is a distributed Version Control System. It is an application by oracle which needs to be download and installed
steps:
  -- go to https://git-scm.com/downloads
  -- select os and select 32/64bits standalone
  -- go with next but check with default editor as vscode and install
  we can also check version by going to cmd and type "git -v"

  steps:
  1. git init
  2. git add .
  3. git commit -m "message"
  for first time users, 
     git config --global user.name "githubUsername"
     git config --global user.email "githubEmail"

Till now, local repository is created.
we need one platform to save,share and run our code
we have so many options like github,gitlab,bitbucket etc..,
github is an online repository management system used to save,share and run our code 

github commands:
  -- git remote add origin 'link'
  -- git push -u origin main

Differnce between git and github?
Git is a distributed version control system and github is online repository system
Git needs to be downloaded and installed. Github needs an account.
Git is provided by oracle. Github is provided by microsoft


Git clone vs Git Fork:
--------------------------
There are two ways to copy a git repository
  1. git clone: git clone is used to copy the original repository and create a new local repository
  since it is a local repository, it will not have any
  connection with original repository
  git clone "link"

  2. git fork: git fork is used to copy the original repository and create a new cloud repository
  since it is cloud repository, it will show you whenever 
  original repository updates
