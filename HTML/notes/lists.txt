Lists in HTML can be denoted in three ways
1. ordered Lists
2. unordered Lists
3. definition Lists

1.ordered Lists:
Some list needs an order to represnt the items. those are defined by ordered lists. orderd lists use 'ol' tag. each list item inside the list use 'li' tag
Eg: <ol>
       <li>abc</li>
       <li>xyz</li>
    </ol>
by default numbers will be assigned as type. we can assign any type we want. we have five options (1,A,a,i,I)

we can also start from wherever we want by defining start attribute

2. unordered Lists: these lists are used when the order is not important 

unordere lists uses 'ul' tag
<ul type="none">
    <li>milk</li>
    <li>rice</li>
    <li>oreo</li>
 </ul>
 we can use types such as circle,square,none
 by default bullet points will be there

3. definition lists: these  lists are used to define topics, to note the events, to keep history

definition lists use dl tag. inside the dl, we have dt(definition term) and dd(definition data).

<dl>
   <dt>
   <dd>
</dl>
