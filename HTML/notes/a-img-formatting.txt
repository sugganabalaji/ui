anchor tag: 
anchor tag is used to link other web pages/other resources. we have a property/attribute to give the link as 'href'.
we use a tag for this. To open new tab we can use 'target' attribute with '_blank' value
  eg: <a href="link">text</a>
  <a href="file path" download>text</a>
  you can also use mailto and tel for different protocols

img: images can be inserted into HTML by img tag.
