Tag vs elements:
for eg:
h1 element -  <h1>content</h1>
anchor element - <a>content</a>
elements are nothing but content with tags. tags can be open or close
There are two types of elements.
 i.inline : inline elements allows next elements to beside them
 eg: a,img,formatting tags
 ii.block : block elements doesn't allw any elements to beside them. they always comes in new line
eg: headings, p, lists,table,semantic elements

General block element -- div
General Inline element -- span
/* make an image and anchor tag  and make them come in different lines using block/inline general elements */
<img src="" alt="" />
<div><a href="">click me</a></div>

semantic elements: 
There are some elements which are used to make search engine understands our code easily. they are called semantic elements
eg: header,main,footer,nav,aside,section,article,figure
but they won't create any impact in UI.
